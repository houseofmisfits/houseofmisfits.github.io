### Discord

#### Chatting 

As you use the House of Misfits Server, other members will have access to data about you, including your availability status and chat history. This is a core function of Discord and outside of our control. We cannot always respond to requests to change this information.

#### Verification

In order to protect the server, our verification processes requires that we collect photos of you. More information about this process can be found on the [verification](/verification) page.

## Use of Information

The analytics obtained on this website are used to understand its usage, improve the website and its content, and to prevent abuse on the server.

The extra data collected via "bots" on Discord are used to provide services for the server, and to prevent abuse. For example, some bots may watch for new emoji reactions to messages and use this information to update the #server-highlights channel. We may also use message history logs to log abusers who edit or delete messages to avoid server moderation.

The photos provided during verification are only used to prevent abuse of the server.

## Sharing of Information

Overall, we do not share information collected outside of Discord or the third party services mentioned above.

It is important to note, however, that some information you provide while using the service is available to all other members using the service, and they may choose to share that information without our knowledge.

Information collected for the use of moderation and preventing abuse is kept in channels visible only to vetted and current staff. Such information can only be shared with current staff members; we will not discuss this information (including ban logs) with other members. Specifically, the photos used for the verification process is only visible to server administrators.
