## What is House of Misfits?

House of Misfits.

In other words, a home for the outcasts. A sanctuary for the abused. A place of comfort for the sick.

Mental illnesses are still very taboo, and it is hard to not feel alone in dealing with them. You're often surrounded by people who don't understand the uphill battle you face just functioning every day. 

We wanted to make a server that doesn't shy away from the icky discussions that come with mental health.

## More to come!

This website is still under construction, so more about the server will eventually be posted here, including informations about donating to the server.
