title: House of Misfits Rules
---

If a rule is broken you will be muted or warned. Disciplinary action will depend on the severity of the rule broken and member compliance to avoid future infractions. All rules can be interpreted by the moderators as they see fit, within reason.

Please note, if you seem suicidal, drunk, or otherwise "not okay," we may mute you to speak to you private and try to get you some help.

All rules apply to usernames and profile pictures, as well. Mods have the right to contact you to change your username or profile picture.


## 1. Keep it civil, respectful, and compassionate.

Don't be hateful or malicious - inciting violence, ganging up on people, encouraging self-harm are all hard no's on this server. Slurs are also not allowed.

Don't be disruptive - if you're drunk/stoned/etc. keep yourself composed. This includes spamming chat messages and sending many photos at once (go to #photos).

Please leave the modding to the Mod team. Ping them. Don't gang up on members who make mistakes.

## 2. Be mindful of your triggers.

Choose to step away instead of engaging in something heated. If a fight breaks out or argument is getting out of hand, ping @Mod.

## 3. You are responsible for your actions during and after you join this server.

Do not use this server as professional advice or as a replacement for professional help.

Please do not guilt trip another member or staff member. 

## 4. Follow [Discord ToS](https://discordapp.com/terms)

Includes no gore, child porn, etc. We also ask for no campaigning/promoting/recruiting in the context of religion or politics.

## 5. We are primarily an English server.

Keep it 95% English, please.

## 6. We are a consent-oriented server.

Ask before flirting, sending pics, etc. <br />
Adults, don't solicit minors. <br />
Minors, don't solicit adults. <br />
Keep public displays of affection in DM's.

## 7. No drama with other members/servers.

Keep that stuff in your DM's. Blur out identifying information about people who aren't in this server. Don't dox people.

## 8. Limit your sexual content.

Minors, please don't post lewds/nudes/sexually explicit content. 

Adults, no pictures of genitalia. Lewds go into #filth.

## 9. Respect people's privacy. 

Don't ask about why someone was banned or muted. The staff also will not share this information.

## 10. We are not lab rats.

No conducting research or sending out surveys without explicit permission from Admins.

## 11. Follow each channel description. 

If you want to know more specifically the rules in a channel, check the channel description. You are subject to disciplinary action if you do not follow these channel rules as well as the server rules. If there is no channel description, just follow server rules.

If you feel like you are being targeted, harassed, or otherwise mistreated by a staff member, please report them by going to #helpdesk and pinging @Admin to DM you.

If you leave the server, you forfeit your purchased roles (colored roles, custom roles, donator role, etc.) and would have to repurchase. We can’t keep track of everyone’s roles so to make it simple, if you leave you have to re-buy them.
